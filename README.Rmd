- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my personal Github profile. My work org. started using Github a few months ago for work-related collaboration, where I have moved all my R/Python automation scripts online. I have also developed a few internal R packages which are extensively used within my team.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Statistics with R from Coursera offered by Duke University. I am also learning to manage my productivity in this pandemic-induced work-from-home period.
