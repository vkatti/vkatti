  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my personal Github profile. My
    work org. started using Github a few months ago for work-related
    collaboration, where I have moved all my R/Python automation scripts
    online. I have also developed a few internal R packages which are
    extensively used within my team.
  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Statistics with R from Coursera offered by
    Duke University. I am also learning to manage my productivity in
    this pandemic-induced work-from-home period.
  - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything R related outside of my
    work network.
  - ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for career guidance.
  - ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how R can help automate your Excel reports.
