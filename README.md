-   :telescope: I’m currently working on building my personal Github
    profile. My work org. started using Github a few months ago for
    work-related collaboration, where I have moved all my R/Python
    automation scripts online. I have also developed a few internal R
    packages which are extensively used within my team.
-   :seedling: I’m currently learning Statistics with R from Coursera
    offered by Duke University. I am also learning to manage my
    productivity in this pandemic-induced work-from-home period.
-   :dancers: I’m looking to collaborate on anything R related outside
    of my work network.
-   :thinking: I’m looking for career guidance.
-   :speech\_balloon: Ask me about how R can help automate your Excel
    reports.
-   :mailbox: How to reach me: twitter
-   :zap: Fun fact: The data in this .md file comes from Google Sheets
    and is created with R and :sparkling\_heart:
